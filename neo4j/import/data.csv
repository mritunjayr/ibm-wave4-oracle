d:50,sql,analysis,c:6,why there is an data mismatch in field assignment procedures?,"when you declare your table columns, you must give each column a data type. make sure this data type covers all necessary values you need to store. once you define a data type, you can only store that type of value in the column.
for instance, you probably need decimal precision by 2-3 points in a column that stores a total order cost. if you assign this column as an integer, your database will only be able to store whole numbers with no decimal values. what happens with the decimals depends on your database platform. it could automatically truncate the values or give you an error. either alternative could create a major bug in your application. always account for what you need to store when you design your tables.
this includes writing queries—when you write your queries and pass parameter values to a stored procedure, the variable must be declared with the right data type. variables that don’t represent the column data type will also throw errors or truncate data in the process.",
