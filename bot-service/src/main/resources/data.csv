1,docker,What is docker,docker is a tool that is designed to help developers create and maintain their apps in an easy and organized way. The way that this program achieves it is by utilizing what are known as containers. The developer can simply add his app (and all of the other required data) into the container and transport it to its destination,,,,,,,
2,docker,What are docker containers,docker containers are the tools that docker uses to pack and ship developer’s apps to their target destination,,,,,,,
3,docker,What are docker ‘images’, images are used to create the container within docker. This is done by issuing the “run” command.,,,,,,,
4,docker,Did docker come up with the ‘container’ technology,Nope, not at all. docker is actually a semi-new project – there are multiple other development tools that offer containers, same as docker,,,,,
5,docker,How is docker better than other tools that use containers, then, docker utilizes the cloud to run its container-relate operations – something that not many other development tools use. Using cloud, docker becomes much more flexible and adaptable to various different scenarios that might come up during the development or shipment processes. This is the main feature for why it is being quite heavily regarded, especially when compared to other container-based developer tools.,,,,
6,docker,What is a dockerfile, A dockerfile is exactly such a set of instructions. Developers provided docker with such instructions so that the program could do the job correctly, with those specific parameters in mind,,,,,,
7,docker, Is the ‘container technology’ reliable, The biggest companies in the world (such as Google, Amazon, Intel and so on) use and trust the container technology – this should be the best answer for if containers are a reliable technology to use or not.,,,,,
8,docker,What are the three main types of docker components,The Client, the Host and the Registry.,,,,,,
9,docker,Will you lose all of your work if you accidentally exit a container,No, you won’t lose any information, data and other parameters if you accidentally exit the docker container. The only way to lose your progress would be to issue a specific command to delete the container,,,,,
10,docker, Can you use any other files for composing instead of the default YAML,Yes, yes you can and there are no clashings or any other types of unwanted occurrences – you can use it without a problem.,,,,,,
11,docker, What are ‘NameSpaces’ use for,Basically, NameSpaces isolate the docker containers from other activities or tampering with them.,,,,,,
12,docker,What is the single most important requirement for building a docker container,The most important requirement for building a container with docker is the default image. This default image may vary depending on the code that you’re using.,,,,,,,
13,docker,How does docker manage ‘dockerized nodes’,A dockerized node can be any machine that has docker installed and running. Now, when it comes to management, the answer is pretty simple – docker can manage both in-house and cloud-based nodes. So, whether the node exists in the area of the main computer running docker or it’s present on the cloud – it does not matter. docker will manage it without a problem.,,,,
14,docker,What are the main factors that dictate the number of containers you can run,There are basically two factors that might limit the number of containers that you can run – the size of your app and your CPU strength.,,,,,,,
15,docker, How is docker different from Hypervisor,Hypervisor requires you to have extensive hardware to function properly, while docker runs on the actual operating system. This allows docker to be exceptionally fast and perform tasks in a fluid manner – something that Hypervisor tends to lack.,,,,,,
16,docker,Does docker run on Linux, macOS, and Windows,You can run both Linux and Windows programs and excutables in docker containers,,,,,
17,docker,How far do docker containers scale,Some of the largest server farms in the world today are based on containers. Large web deployments like Google and Twitter, and platform providers such as Heroku run on container technology, at a scale of hundreds of thousands or even millions of containers.,,,,,
18,docker,How do I connect docker containers,Currently the recommended way to connect containers is via the docker network feature,,,,,,,
19,docker,How do I run more than one process in a docker container,This approach is discouraged for most use cases. For maximum efficiency and isolation, each container should address one specific area of concern. However, if you need to run multiple services within a single container,,,,,
20,docker,What platforms does docker run on,Linux,Microsoft Windows,Cloud,,,,,
21,docker,How do I report a security issue with docker,If you are a docker Enterprise customer, please file a support case. Otherwise, please file a support case using the Account Support Form. Please include as much information as possible including the repository, image, and tag where you suspect a security issue, your name and email so we can contact you, and any other information you feel is relevant,
